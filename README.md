My name is Justen Phelps and I am taking this test to apply and present myself as a viable candidate for the Front End Developer Position for Zehner Group. Below is a breakdown of how my time was spent:
_______
Hour 1:
- Uploading PSD and estimating sizes used for header and large divs with background images
- Creating the navigation bar using Bootstrap to maximize potential time and allow more time
for custom dropdown menus and possible future issues
- Saved Dropdown Menu for further into the test to make sure I finished a large majority of the
design
- Found Juice Served Here logo on Google Images, used the image without compression due
to smaller image size
- Used feather (https://feathericons.com/) for the shopping bag icon / svg
- By using an SVG it allowed me to edit the fill color and stroke colors
- Began work on the first div section / image
- Chose the picture based on the color scheme of the PSD given to me. I could not find the
image used in the PSD, so I used an image from Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/) instead
that matched the colors as correctly as I could find
- The image was fairly large, and in order to avoid page speed issues, I hosted the image on
Cloudinary (https://cloudinary.com/console). This allowed the image to be not be hosted
locally and provide much better results
- Placed the image as a background for the div to allow addition of text and / or buttons over
the top
- Created the ‘VIEW MENU’ button using Bootstrap’s ‘btn-lg’ class with a custom class of
‘btn-custom’ allowing me to override any styles preset by Bootstrap
- Positioned the button on the image using position: relative, making the div the parent
element
- Moved to the second large container
- Created separate divs for the heading and subheading to make centering and spacing easier
- Created the background images for ’01’ ’02’ ’03’ using Sketch, exported as PNG and used
as background image for three separate divs, allowing me to place text over them
- Images created a repeat bug and I had to use ‘background-repeat: no-repeat’ and center the
background
- Divs are placed evenly so they could be responsive towards the end of the test
- Placed another bootstrap button towards the center of the div, with light padding above to
     match the PSD
Hour 2:
- Moved to next large section
- Found an image that matched the one given in the PSD, but from a different source that had
dimensions of 1600x1600
- This made it difficult to get the positioning correctly on the back of the div
- Using ‘background-position: 0px 350px’ I was able to place it in a similar position as the
PSD
- Created separate divs for heading and subheading again
- Places a span of ‘______’ between the heading and subheading to use as the orange colored
line break
- Used an outline-btn-danger Bootstrap button and customized the colors and behavior to
match the one given in the PSD
- Read up on positioning on CSS Tricks (https://css-tricks.com/) and Image Overlays for the
next section
Hour 3:
- Used CSS Grid to create the ‘Pick Your Pleasure’ section
- Read up on some tips and usage cases for CSS-Grid on CSS Tricks (https://css-tricks.com/)
- Read some more on Overlays and how they worked in Grid & if they affected it at all (which
they dont)
- Create a 4 column grid with 1 row. Each column being 1fr to account for responsiveness
- Row is 300px, which was just an aesthetic choice
- Created Overlay div for each grid element, gave it the opacity of 0. Then with :hover I
switched the opacity to 1, and used position: relative to stretch the overlay over the entire
grid element
- Styled the overlay to match the PSD
- Found images similar to the ones on the PSD on Google Images
Hour 4:
- Noticed I was running out of time and decided to focus on the dropdown menu and responsiveness instead of continuing down the page
- I figured that having a working page instead of just an HTML image or mockup would be preferred
- Began working on the Dropdown Menu
- Used Bootstrap again on the Dropdown to save time and maximize responsiveness
- Created UL & LI’s within the dropdown menu div
- Padded and spaced uls / lis to match as closely as possible to the PSD
- Found the exact image used in the dropdown menu on the PSD
- Spent 20 minutes figuring out how to fit the image to the dropdown without having it break
outside
- Used imp-fluid and adjusted the height of the image and dropdown menu and figured it out
finally
- Changed logo width to percentage instead of set width to help responsive sizing
- Double checked the rest of the site to make sure I wasn’t missing anything critical
- Decided to write the documentation and make sure I didn’t go over the deadline!
I hope my entry was up to your expectations. I really had a great time with this, and wanted to thank you again for giving me this opportunity.
